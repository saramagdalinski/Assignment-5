\Problem{1}{Count all unweighted distinct shortest paths}{15}

On unweighted graphs, we define a shortest path from vertices $u$ to $v$ to be the path from $u$ to $v$ with the fewest edges traversed.
Often there are multiple shortest paths between two nodes of a graph. Give a linear-time algorithm ($O(m + n)$) for the following task:

\textit{Input:} Undirected unweighted graph $G = (V, E)$; nodes $u, v \in V$.

\textit{Output:} The number of distinct shortest paths from $u$ to $v$.

(Hint: is there some way you can think to modify BFS to count shortest paths, rather than just finding shortest paths in an unweighted graph?)

\textbf{Solution:}
